# ATM-Machine
Simple React ATM
## Description
For this project I was given starter code of a simple react atm where you could put in an amount of money and it would be added to your total account balance. I was given instrustion to take this starter code and refactor it to make it more efficient and have more validation to make it more life like.

Some improvements I made was adding a selection button to chose to deposit money to your account or withdraw money from the account. I then added an isValid when cash back is chosen to validate whether the transaction is can go through. If the user wanted to withdraw more than they had in their account then the submit button would be disabled and they would not be able to make the withdraw. 

Also improved efficiency with making an isDeposit to allow the setDeposit and make overall selection and validation easier.
